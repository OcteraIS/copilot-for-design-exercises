# Question 4

## Description

You are designing a remote for controlling devices in your home. Currently, you have a single device you want to control: color-changing light panels. You are planning on adding more devices in the future. There are currently three commands you want to send to the panels: on, change brightness to 10 (dim), and change color to blue. Leverage the command pattern to design a ```RemoteControl``` class that controls devices. Configure the remote to control your color-changing light panels. The remote should be able to undo the three most recent commands issued.

## Criteria

Add a main method to your ```RemoteControl``` class demonstrating the construction of a remote, execution of the three color-changing light panel commands (on, change brightness to 10 (dim), and change color to blue), and undoing the three most recent commands issued.
