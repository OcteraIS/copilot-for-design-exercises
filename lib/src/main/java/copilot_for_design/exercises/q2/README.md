# Question 2

## Description

Your fresh startup is working on adding simulation capabilities to your web application that lets customers design robots, but the library you are working with ([`ThirdPartyLibrary.java`](ThirdPartyLibrary.java)) does not accept `Pair` instances and only accepts units in metric â€“ while your code ([`SimulationController.java`](SimulationController.java)) handles `Pair` instances and imperial units. Leverage the adapter pattern to resolve these two discrepancies.

## Additional Constraints

You must not alter any code in [`ThirdPartyLibrary.java`](ThirdPartyLibrary.java).

## Criteria

Complete the three TODO comments in [`SimulationController.java`](SimulationController.java). After your changes, [`SimulationController.java`](SimulationController.java) should interact with [`ThirdPartyLibrary.java`](ThirdPartyLibrary.java) through the adapter. Add print statements to your adapter demonstrating how it affects interactions between [`SimulationController.java`](SimulationController.java) and [`ThirdPartyLibrary.java`](ThirdPartyLibrary.java).
