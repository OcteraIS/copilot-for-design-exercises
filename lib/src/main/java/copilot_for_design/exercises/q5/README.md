# Question 5

## Description

Your web application for designing robots has made great headway, but the simulation feature is consuming a massive amount of memory. After some investigation, you realize that the obstacles in the scene are the culprits of the memory use. Leverage the flyweight pattern to reduce memory usage by sharing intrinsic state between obstacles.

## Criteria

Write a main method in [`Obstacle.java`](Obstacle.java) demonstrating the creation of flyweight instances and show that the intrinsic state of flyweight instances is shared.
