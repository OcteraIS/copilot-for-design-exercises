# Instructions

## Description

For each question, refer to the associated README for a description of the task and its completion criteria. 

Some skeleton code is provided for each question. This code is intentionally unpolished and imperfect. You are welcome (and encouraged!) to refactor the provided code to suit your solution and clean-code principles - subject to the constraints described below (and in the exercise's README, if applicable).

There is not a single solution for any exercise. Exercise descriptions are intentionally imprecise to allow students room to craft flexible/creative solutions according to their knowledge and preferences.

## Constraints

For each question, you should modify the provided code by adding/removing/modifying files.

There are two constraints:

* All solution code must exist within the question's package (`copilot_for_design.exercises.q<X>`, where `X` is the question number).

* Any functionality or information in the original code must be preserved somewhere in your solution to the question.

### Examples

Sufficient:

* Removing a provided `Car.drive()` method as the solution provides another way to accomplish the same goal (ie., driving the car).

* Renaming a provided `name` field to `dealershipName`.

* Adding a `refuel` method to a provided `Car` class.

* Removing a redundant parameter from a provided method.

Insufficient:

* Replacing a continuous `price` field with a categorical `priceBin` field (the exact value is lost!).

* Removing a `numSeats` field from a provided `Car` class without storing this information elsewhere.
