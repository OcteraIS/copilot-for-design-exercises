     * Copilot by placing your cursor on the next line (indented) after the
     * method description comment, waiting a second for a suggestion to
     * appear, and then using one of the following commands:
     *     TAB: accept the suggestion
     *     ESC: reject the suggestion
     *     ⌥+] or Alt+]: see next suggestion
     *     ⌥+[ or Alt+[: see previous suggestion

     * TIP: if a suggestion does not appear, or it is not what you want,
     * try improving the comment or writing the method signature yourself.
     * 
     * NOTE: sometimes there may not be a previous/next suggestion to see.
