     * For the following method descriptions/comments, experiment with
     * GitHub Copilot by doing the following:
     *    1) place your cursor on the next line (indented) after the comment
     *    2) wait a second for a suggestion to appear
     *    3) use one of the following commands:
     *        TAB: accept the suggestion
     *        ESC: reject the suggestion
     *        CTRL + ENTER: open the Copilot sidebar for more suggestions
     *        Option (⌥) + ] or Alt + ]: see next suggestion (if available)
     *        Option (⌥) + [ or Alt + [: see previous suggestion (if available)
     * 
     * NOTE: Option (⌥) + \ or ALT + \: triggers a suggestion manually
     *
     * TIP1: if a suggestion does not appear right away, try to start writing
     *   the method yourself.
     * 
     * TIP2: if a suggestion appears but is not what you want, try the
     *   next/previous suggestions and the Copilot sidebar (commands above).
