# Copilot for Design: Exercises

*Student Use of AI Assistance in Software Design Tasks* is a study planned at the University of Victoria to investigate
how AI code suggestion tools impact student learning, satisfaction, productivity, and success - within the context of
software design. This repository contains exercises to provide to participants. Participants will consist of third-year
software engineering and computer science students at the University of Victoria.

Participants should consider [lib/src/main/java/copilot_for_design](lib/src/main/java/copilot_for_design) for programming-related study materials.
